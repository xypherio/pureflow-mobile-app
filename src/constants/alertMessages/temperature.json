  "low": [
    "Cold water below normal slows fish energy use, making them eat less and grow slower",
    "Low temperature makes fish defenses weak, easier for parasites to attack them",
    "Cold weather delays fish spawning and fewer baby fish eggs survive",
    "Water too cold slows body processes, harder for fish to digest food and get nutrients",
    "Cold water holds less oxygen, forcing fish to work harder to breathe",
    "Low heat makes fish use more energy to stay warm, reducing harvest weights",
    "Cold conditions make fish lose appetite, getting thin from lack of proper nutrition",
    "Temperature too low affects baby-making chemicals, messing up breeding times",
    "Cold temperature slows healing from wounds, increasing chance of other sicknesses",
    "Cold weather slows germ breakdown, affecting food release for your plants"
  ],
  "high": [
    "Hot water above normal shocks fish suddenly, hurting breathing parts and oxygen carrying",
    "High temperature speeds up fish energy use, needing more oxygen and causing stress",
    "Heat affects baby fish making, reducing egg quality and baby production",
    "Water too hot weakens fish defenses, making them easy targets for diseases",
    "Hot conditions push oxygen out of water, causing fish to suffocate and die",
    "High heat makes harmful wastes more dangerous, poisoning fish bodies",
    "Heat changes fish eating habits, eating less feed and losing weight",
    "Temperature extremes grow bad germs fast, making water dirty and sickening plants",
    "Hot water makes fish tired and lazy, harder to catch during harvest time",
    "High temperatures grow bad algae fast, poisoning both fish and plant crops"
